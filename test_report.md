# Idle Person Detection System - Test Report

## Executive Summary

The Idle Person Detection System has been tested for functionality and integration. The system consists of a FastAPI backend, React frontend, and MongoDB database. The testing revealed several critical issues that prevent the system from functioning properly.

## Test Results

### 1. Backend API Testing

| Endpoint | Method | Status | Result | Notes |

| `/api/` | GET | ✅ PASS | 200 OK | System status endpoint works |
| `/api/config/detection` | GET | ✅ PASS | 200 OK | Configuration retrieval works |
| `/api/config/detection` | POST | ❌ FAIL | 500 Error | MongoDB ObjectId serialization issue |
| `/api/roi/current` | GET | ✅ PASS | 200 OK | ROI retrieval works |
| `/api/roi/set` | POST | ❌ FAIL | 500 Error | MongoDB ObjectId serialization issue |
| `/api/video/start` | POST | ❌ FAIL | 500 Error | Video processing start fails |
| `/api/video/stop` | POST | ❓ NOT TESTED | - | Not tested as video never started |
| `/api/stats` | GET | ❓ NOT TESTED | - | Not tested as video never started |
| `/api/persons` | GET | ❓ NOT TESTED | - | Not tested as video never started |
| `/api/persons/idle` | GET | ❓ NOT TESTED | - | Not tested as video never started |
| `/api/video/frame` | GET | ❓ NOT TESTED | - | Not tested as video never started |
| `/api/video/upload` | POST | ❓ NOT TESTED | - | Not tested |

### 2. Frontend UI Testing

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Page Load | ✅ PASS | UI loads correctly with all components |
| Video Source Configuration | ✅ PASS | UI elements work, but backend fails |
| Detection Settings | ✅ PASS | Sliders work, but config update fails |
| ROI Drawing | ❌ FAIL | Button disabled (no video feed) |
| Real-time Statistics | ❓ PARTIAL | UI elements present but no data |
| Live Video Feed | ❌ FAIL | No video feed available |
| Person List | ❓ PARTIAL | UI element present but no data |

### 3. WebSocket Testing

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Connection | ✅ PASS | WebSocket connection established |
| Real-time Updates | ❌ FAIL | Messages received but not of expected type |
| Data Format | ❌ FAIL | No detection data in messages |

## Critical Issues

1. **MongoDB ObjectId Serialization**:
   - Error: `TypeError: 'ObjectId' object is not iterable`
   - Impact: Prevents database operations for configuration, ROI, and alerts
   - Severity: Critical

2. **Video Source Access**:
   - Error: `VIDEOIO(V4L2:/dev/video0): can't open camera by index`
   - Impact: Cannot access webcam in container environment
   - Severity: High

3. **WebSocket Data Format**:
   - Issue: WebSocket messages don't contain expected detection data
   - Impact: Real-time updates not functioning
   - Severity: High

## Recommendations

1. **Fix MongoDB ObjectId Serialization**:
   - Modify the backend code to properly convert ObjectId to string before JSON serialization
   - Example: `roi_config["_id"] = str(roi_config["_id"])` for all database responses

2. **Add Video Source Fallbacks**:
   - Implement fallback mechanisms for when camera access fails
   - Add sample video file for testing in container environments

3. **Improve Error Handling**:
   - Add more robust error handling in the backend
   - Provide clear error messages to the frontend

4. **WebSocket Protocol**:
   - Ensure WebSocket messages follow the expected format
   - Verify WebSocket server implementation

## Conclusion

The Idle Person Detection System has a solid architecture and UI design, but critical implementation issues prevent it from functioning properly. The most urgent issue is the MongoDB ObjectId serialization problem, which affects multiple core features. Once these issues are addressed, further testing will be needed to verify the computer vision and idle detection functionality.
